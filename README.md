# EquationSystemProgram
# This program can solve specified or generated linear equation systems. To date it can only handle equation systems with a singular unparametirized sollution
# Should you wish to see the solution (see if there is a unique sollution) for a given linear equation system, enter it in the file EquationSystem.txt with the following
# convention:
# x₀ + x₁ - 3x₂ + x₃  = 2
# -5x₀ + 3x₁ - 4x₂ + x₃  = 0
# x₀ + 2x₂ - x₃  = 1
# x₀ + 2x₁  = 12
# need to be inserted as the following string:
# 1 1 -3 1 2
# -5 3 -4 1 0
# 1 0 2 -1 1
# 1 2 0 0 12
